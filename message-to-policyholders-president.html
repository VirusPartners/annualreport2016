									<p>Amid the challenges in the global economy and here at home, your Board of Trustees is again pleased to report that another year of good results for the Insular Group. We posted &#8369;4.9 billion in consolidated net income in 2016, 172 percent higher than the &#8369;1.8 billion in 2015. Our consolidated total revenues grew by 25 percent to &#8369;25 billion on the back of higher gains from the sale of equities and properties, investment income and earnings of associates.</p>

									<p>In comparison, the local insurance industry recorded flat growth of 0.29% in terms of total premium income in 2016, with the life sector posting a decline while non-life players posted a significant expansion, according to the Insurance Commission (IC).</p>

									<p>The investments we have made in recent years are starting to pay off, and we expect these will continue to grow. Of particular note are the investments we made in upgrading our core technology platform to better respond to policyholders’ needs as they choose to manage their finances in new and different ways.</p>

									<p>Such changes bring new and different risks as well. Your Board has worked closely with the senior management team, as well as our regulators, to ensure we remain on the leading edge of these developments. We have made significant investments in risk management and compliance that make us stronger and more resilient.</p>

									<h2>How would you describe Insular’s performance in

									2016? What are the main drivers of growth?</h2>

									<p>Our Insular Life Group earned a record-breaking net income of &#8369;4.9 billion, &#8369;3.1 billion or 172 percent 

									increase compared to &#8369;1.8 billion in 2015. Our consolidated revenues reached &#8369;25 billion, up by &#8369;5 billion or 

									25 percent from the &#8369;20 billion in the previous year. The increase in revenues was due to higher

									gains from sale of equities and properties, investment income and earnings of our associates. Consolidated total

									assets went up to &#8369;129 billion, &#8369;23 billion or 22 percent more than &#8369;106 billion a year ago. Consolidated net 

									worth amounted to &#8369;40.3 billion, up by &#8369;16.6 billion or 70 percent from &#8369;23.7 billion in 2015. While Insular Life 

									posted monthly increases in new business premium production for eight consecutive months and also increased its renewal 

									premiums, we were not shielded from the volatile market conditions that caused a sharp drop in single premiums. As a result,

									our total premium income was slightly down by &#8369;380 million or 3 percent to &#8369;12.3 billion, 

									reflective of the industry decline of 3 percent. Still, I believe Insular Life’s

									overall performance in 2016 was exemplary. We attribute this achivement to

									the robust revenues from insurance and investment, and from higher capital gains on the sale of shares of stocks and properties. The increase in members’

									equity can be attributed to the gains in the market value of our equity holdings and our higher net income.</p>

									<h2>What factors in the external and internal

									environment contributed to your performance?</h2>

									<p>On the financial front, we had to make certain

										decisions in the light of regulatory initiatives on Risk-Based Capital (RBC). We saw an opportunity to realign

										our assets towards income generation to further

										strengthen our RBC position. The successful initial

										public offering of one of our major equity holdings

										also had a significant and positive impact on the value

									of our investments.</p>

									<p>On the sales side: a slower-than-usual market

										response at the beginning of 2016 had the biggest

										impact on our business production. Notwithstanding

										this slow pace, Insular Life’s equity funds that support

										our investment-linked insurance products were the

										best-performing funds in 2016 and have consistently

									outperformed the Philippine Stock Exchange Index.</p>

									<p>Inheriting a 106-year old company from a

									<h2 class="no-leading">How did you arrive at the decision to go into

									bancassurance?</h2>

									<p>Historically, Insular’s business model has been

										built on its strong, resilient agency franchise. In recent

										years, however, both in the country and overseas,

										other sales channels have emerged and have been

										performing significantly, notably bancassurance

										distribution. Increasingly, customers want to have

										more options on how they want to interact with

										their potential insurer. They will do so via a channel

										of their choosing. We need to continue developing

										multi-channel distribution capabilities, including

										bancassurance, in order to remain competitive and to

									help secure the long-term future of the Company.</p>

									<h2>How will Insular benefit from its bancassurance

									partnership with a technology-driven bank like

									UnionBank?</h2>

									<p>We were in search of a bancassurance partner

										that shares our values. We have a long tradition of

										steadfast commitment to our policyholders. Insular

										Life is a trusted and respected company in an industry

									dominated by foreign players.</p>

									<p>Through this bancassurance partnerhip, we will

										benefit from UnionBank’s group network of over

										300 branches and offices with more than six million

										customers. It opens up a new distribution channel to

										complement our agency franchise and provides a new

									revenue stream for both our institutions.</p>

									<p>As with any partnership, there is no greater feeling

										than that of finding the right bancassurance partner, and

										together, providing products and services which impact

									Filipino families and communities in a profound way.</p>

									<p>Bancassurance provides for bilateral benefits to

										both parties. For UnionBank, the agreement makes it

										possible to complete its product suite that ultimately

										helps customers elevate their lives and fulfill their

										dreams. Together, we will continue to create value for

										the stakeholders of our two great companies and assert

									leadership in our respective industries.</p>

									structure and demutualization was one of the

									options that Insular might pursue. Has the Board

									and Management already arrived at a decision

									on demutualization?</h2>

									<p>Demutualization remains in the agenda. We have

									done extensive consultation and research on this,

									including the experiences of insurers in other countries,

									and after much deliberation and consideration, the

									Board of Trustees has decided to defer the undertaking

									to a later date. We will revisit this once we see a

									compelling need to change our corporate structure

									within a changing business environment, and of course,

									always taking into consideration what is best for our

									policyholders.</p>

									<h2>What growth opportunities do you see for Insular in

									2017, and how will this impact your policyholders?</h2>

									<p>2017 and beyond will continue to be challenging

										given the many external developments, both here

										and abroad, that are still unfolding and will surely

										influence this “new normal” space that we operate in.

										Transformation and allowing ourselves to be disrupted

										would be critical. We need to keep our focus on the

									strategic priorities that we laid out for ourselves.</p>

									<p>Subsequently, all initiatives are directed towards

										providing customer excellence by putting their

										perspective first in our decisions and operational

										capability. With even greater resolve we recognize the

										changing dynamics of customer engagement and their

									new expectations.</p>

									<h2>What is your outlook – both for the global and local

									economies, as well as the Philippine insurance

									sector – this 2017?</h2>

									<p>I do not have a crystal ball nor will I attempt to

										forecast the future. We all read, watch and hear from

										most likely the same sources. This said, I view 2017

										with continued optimism. There is so much going for

										the Philippine economy: the government’s serious

										infrastructure development programs, as well as

										consumption spending fueled by OFW remittances and

									BPOs contributing decent growth to our GDP.</p>

									<p>We cannot be distracted by short-term events;

										instead, we need to keep our focus on our key

										stakeholders and deliver on our commitments to them.

										Planning forward and seeking opportunities in these

										hard-to-predict times drive one to create a really strong

										company, keeping true to our values and culture,

										constantly seeking ways to transform and innovate,

										and yes, look after our people. It is only by pursuing all

										these relentlessly that we stay a relevant and respected

									institution way beyond our 106 years.</p>

									<p>Because Insular is the “Most Trusted Brand” in

										the life insurance industry, a distinction we carry proud

										and tall, it is incumbent on all of us to secure the

										organization’s future decades from now. The attributes

										of trustworthiness and credibility, quality, value,

										understanding customer needs, innovation, and social

										responsibility are intangible but powerful measures that

									we will continue to pursue and live by.</p>

											<span class="title">Insular and UnionBank Partnership</span>

											<p><span class="big-letter">W</span>ith a growing economic pie that is racing the world’s

											developed economies, the Philippines is considered

											a fertile spot for financial instruments. And with interest

											rates still relatively low, banks find themselves competing

											against other financial institutions that offer investment-linked

											instruments with higher yields than those gained from

											traditional savings accounts.</p>

											<p>In this age of collaboration, however, these institutions

											realize that the mantra, “If you can’t beat them, join them”

											makes more business sense. So as not to compete for a

											share of their customers’ wallet, they instead partner for

											mutual gain.</p>

											<p>And this is where “bancassurance” comes in.</p>

											<p>Bancassurance refers to the selling of insurance policies

											within bank branches. Under Republic Act 10607 or the

											amended Insurance Code, banks are no longer required

											to have a 5 percent equity in insurance companies to

											enter into a bancassurance deal. Any lender can enter the

											bancassurance business as long as the bank complies with

											the requirements of the Insurance Commission and the

											Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. </p>

											<p>In 2016, homegrown insurance giant Insular Life started

											exploring a bancassurance partner, and finally entered into

											a bancassurance agreement with Aboitiz-led Union Bank of

											the Philippines (UnionBank) in early 2017.</p>

											<p> UnionBank and its wholly owned subsidiary, City Savings

											Bank, will distribute and sell Insular Life products through its

											network of over 300 branches and offices nationwide with

											more than six million customers. </p>

											<p>“Bancassurance opens up a new distribution channel

											to complement our agency franchise and provides a new

											revenue stream for both our institutions,” said Nina D.

											Aguas, Insular Life’s Chief Executive Officer. </p>

											<p> UnionBank President and Chief Operating Officer Edwin

											R. Bautista said of the partnership, “At the end of each day,

											we UnionBankers always ask ourselves whether we served

											our customers in a way that helped them elevate their lives

											and fulfill their dreams. Before this partnership with Insular

											Life, I was always hesitant to answer “yes” convincingly, as

											I thought we missed an important and basic component –

											insurance. I am delighted that we are finally completing our

											product suite, and even more thrilled that we are signing

											with a company that has a long history of being our partner.

											We see this partnership enduring for decades.”</p>

											<p>“As with any partnership, there is no greater feeling

											than that of finding the right bancassurance partner. For us in Insular Life, that’s UnionBank. We were in search of

											a bancassurance partner who shares our values. We have

											a long tradition of steadfast commitment to our policy

											holders, a respected Filipino company in a Philippine

											industry dominated by foreigners. UnionBank is also a proud

											Filipino company, recognized internationally, as among the

											best-in-class in global league tables,” Aguas explained.</p>

											<p>While both institutions have been long-time partners,

											with Insular Life owning an equity stake in UnionBank, the

											106-year old insurer still had to go through a tedious bidding

											process to seal the deal.</p>

											<p>To win UnionBank’s heart, Insular Life bested four

											major foreign players setting their sights on the lucrative

											partnership. The fact that both Insular Life and UnionBank

											are 100 percent Filipino-owned is no pure coincidence.</p>

											<p>“We have a 106-year track record in the Philippines

											and UnionBank has been serving the local market for nearly

											half a century now. We both know the kind of products

											and services that will benefit and impact the lives of Filipino

											families and communities in a profound way,” Ms. Aguas said.</p>

											<p>Aside from corporate pedigree, Insular also share the

											universal bank’s pioneering spirit when it comes to service

											innovation. In 2016, the local insurer introduced a game changer in the Philippine insurance industry when it launched

											the Automated Underwriting (AU) system. Under the setup, an

											Insular Life financial advisor can underwrite a customer as soon

											as the latter decides on a product. This enables the insurer to

											quickly render an underwriting decision in the process. </p>

											<p>“While many foreign companies already have a system for

											underwriting submissions, they don’t have a system that renders

											automated decision like ours. So it was also having an IT edge

											that clinched us the bancassurance partnership, in addition to

											the unique business model that we proposed,” Ms. Mona Lisa

											B. de la Cruz, Insular Life President and Chief Operating Officer,

											added.</p>

											<p>Mr. Omar T. Cruz, former president of a bancassurance

											business joint venture, and former Philippine National Treasurer,

											was appointed Insular Life Senior Executive Vice President tasked

											with leading the bancassurance operations.</p>

											<p>With bancassurance, Insular Life will be able to reach out

											to more Filipinos and help the country improve its insurance

											penetration rate, now the lowest in the ASEAN region at less

											than 2 percent of GDP. It will also enable the Company to fulfill

											its corporate mission: to provide a full-range of high-value

											insurance products and other related services that empower

											families to attain financial security and fulfill their dreams.</p>

									</div>

									<p class="head-text indent">The Philippines’ insurance sector is on the threshold of a dramatic

									transformation. With opportunities from the ASEAN integration and

									from the increasing use of digital technology, as well as emerging

									risks from market volatility, cyber crime, fraud or corporate liability, the

									Insurance Commission has been laying down reforms to strengthen

									the sector.</p>

								</div>

								<div class="policyholder-body">

									<p>Ms. Mona Lisa B. de la Cruz, Insular Life President and Chief

										Operating Officer, talks about how the Company continues to make

										significant progress amid the changing landscape, and how it is future-proofing

									the business.</p>

									<h2>How did the local insurance sector fare in 2016?</h2>

									<p>The year 2016 was filled with uncertainty.

										Everywhere — from “Brexit” and China’s economic

										slowdown, to the surprising outcome of the U.S.

										presidential election as well as ours — there were

										just too many political and policy uncertainties,

										enough to send businesses and investors on a

										rollercoaster ride. Naturally, these jitters made

										people hold back on major investments, including

									insurance.</p>

									<p>In the Philippines’ case, this was quite

										pronounced towards the May presidential election,

										not knowing the winning candidate early on, and

										how his administration will lead to drastic policy

										changes. This political anxiety somewhat ebbed

										when the President-elect made a pronouncement

										that he will continue and maintain the economic

									policies of his predecessor.</p>

									<p>As a result of the market uncertainty, the local

										insurance sector did not grow as much in terms

										of premiums. The latest data from the Insurance

										Commission (IC) show flattish growth in total

										premiums for 2016, on the back of a decline in

										the premium production of the life sector. The

										value of total premiums grew by 0.29 percent to

										&#8369;231.9 billion versus &#8369;231.2 billion in 2015. Total life

										premiums fell by 3.04 percent to &#8369;182.8 billion from

										&#8369;188.5 billion, year-on-year. The decline was slightly

										offset by the increase in the non-life sector, with

										total net premiums of &#8369;41.6 billion, or 16.24 percent

									higher than &#8369;35.8 billion in 2015.</p>

									<h2 class="no-leading">How did Insular manage to have positive

									financial results despite the political and

									economic headwinds in 2016?</h2>

									<p>In a year filled with uncertainty, we performed

									extremely well. Parent company Insular Life

									generated net income of &#8369;3.7 billion, up from

									&#8369;1.4 billion in 2015. We also posted &#8369;23.4 billion in

									revenues, an increase of 21 percent. Contributing

									heavily to the Company’s very good performance

									are the significant growth in investment income

									particularly dividends from equity investments,

									and realized gains. During the year, the Company

									booked gains of &#8369;3.3 billion from the sale of stocks

									and &#8369;1.9 billion from the sale of properties.</p>

									<p>Parent company’s assets grew 23 percent, from

										&#8369;108 billion to &#8369;133 billion, for the same period in

										review. We had a net worth of &#8369;43.9 billion, a

									72 percent improvement from the 2015 level.</p>

									<p>Total business-in-force in 2016 stood at

										&#8369;267.3 billion, with 334,996 policies. This represented

										a 6 percent growth from the previous year’s

									&#8369;251.5 billion, with 321,281 policies in force.</p>

									<h2>The stock markets around the world were on a

									Reserve rate hike. How did Insular Life’s Wealth

									Series unit-linked funds survive this turbulence?</h2>

									<p>Insular manages nine funds under the Wealth

										Series portfolio, and their combined fund value as of

										31 December 2016 was &#8369;21.2 billion. Despite the fact

										that the Philippine composite index declined by

										1.6 percent year-on-year, our Equity Fund, Growth

										Fund, and Balanced Fund still managed to emerge as

									the best-performing funds in their category for 2016.</p>

									<p>Our peso-denominated funds outperformed the

									market in general. Through it all, most investors of

									Insular Life’s variable unit-linked (VUL) funds held on

									and were rewarded by very decent returns. Among

									these funds, the Growth Fund posted the highest

									return at 4.04 percent, followed by the Equity Fund

									at 3.21 percent. The Balanced Fund, a mixed basket

									of equity and fixed-income assets, also delivered a

									respectable return of 2.64 percent.

									The commendable performance of these funds is

									really good news to our VUL policyholders.</p>

									<h2 class="no-leading">What new products did you launch in 2016?</h2>

									<p>We consider 2016 as an “opportunistic” year for

									new investments. Thus, in addition to our six openend

									variable funds, we launched three new variable

									unit-linked (VUL) funds: the Guardian Fund and

									the Peso and Dollar Money Market Funds. We also

									launched a new Variable Returns Asset (VRA) product

									package, the First Million Fund.</p>

									<p>Other new products launched in 2016 were

										Wealth Protect, Payor Riders for Death and Disability

										(PR and PR WPD), and Waiver of Premium Rider (WPD)

									for VUL products.</p>

									<p>More than delivering returns, these VUL products

										provide insurance protection, such that whatever

										happens, a policyholder’s family is still protected from

									the risk of income loss.</p>

									<h2>What would you consider as a company

										milestone in 2016?</h2>

									<p>While we made great strides since embarking on

										our <span class="ital">“Magandang Araw”</span> service brand, we continue

										to improve on our service delivery to serve our

									customers even better.</p>

									<p>In 2016, we started taking our customer journey

										farther by offering an “omni channel” world of

										customer experience. This means providing as many

										customer touch points as possible, deepening our

										understanding of our customers, as well as being

										more responsive to their needs. By focusing on ways

										to enhance customer experience, we also improve

									on our operational efficiency.</p>

									<p>To improve new business efficiency and to

										attract a more tech-savvy sales force, we took

										the lead in utilizing technology to speed up the

										insurance policy application process. In November

										2016, we launched the first integrated web-based

										proposal, sales illustration, and Automated

										Underwriting (AU) system in the Philippines. This can

									be accessed through our online agent portal.</p>

									<p>Under the new AU system, the application

										process and the delivery of the new policy are much

										faster. We were able to cut the waiting period, from

										the previous two to three days, to as short as a few

										minutes. Underwriting decisions are immediately

										given, and ratings are reflected in the proposals.

										This, and having a single customer view, enable us

										to better serve our clients by offering products that

										are more suited to their profiles and needs at much

									faster delivery times.</p>

									<p>We are also excited about the launch of our

										e-commerce platform that will introduce a new

										distribution line for Insular Life. This platform is well-suited

										to the new generation of customers who are

									comfortable with end-to-end processes done online.</p>

									<h2 class="no-leading">Insular Life recently entered into a bancassurance

										partnership with Union Bank of the Philippines.

										How will this help you reach more customers?</h2>

										<p>Bancassurance is increasingly becoming

											a key growth area for banks across the region.

											This partnership will enable Insular to cross-sell

											our insurance products within the premises

											of UnionBank or any of its network of over 300

											branches and offices to more than six million

										customers.</p>

										<p>Bancassurance will strengthen our agency force

											and enable us to reach more customers. We hope to

										double our production as a result.</p>

										<p>The local insurance market is still in a very

											nascent growth stage. Insurance penetration – or

											the ratio of insurance premium to Gross Domestic

											Product (GDP) – at less than 2 percent of the

											country’s GDP in 2016, is among the lowest in

											the region, according to the ASEAN Insurance

											Council (AIC) and the Insurance Commission of the

											Philippines. Given this situation, the expansion of

											our distribution capabilities through our partnership

											with UnionBank will enable us to help more Filipinos

										get the insurance protection they need.</p>

										<h2 class="no-leading">For an institution that is already 106 years old,

										how do you remain relevant to the millennial

										generation?</h2>

										<p>Some Asian markets already have an ageing

											population and, as a result, are experiencing

											economic slowdown. The Philippines is in a different

											stage: it is just beginning to reap the so-called

											“demographic dividend” with a bigger chunk of

											Filipinos making money as part of the workforce,

										against the number of young and old dependents.</p>

										<p>This is why we at Insular Life want to invest in

											the future of our millennial customers. We know that

											millennials do not stay in the YOLO (“You Only Live

											Once”) phase forever. Eventually, they transition to

											concern themselves with the more serious aspects of

											life, a phase that millennials have dubbed ‘adulting’.

											Part of this adulting phase is realizing the need to

											save for their future and become more conscious

										about reaching their financial goals.</p>

										

									<p>In order to deepen our relationship with

										our young policyholders, we have come up with

										products and services that are more relevant to their

										adulting needs, such as the First Million Fund. We

										have also been able to attract a growing number of

										millennial agents who are at their adulting phase,

										stepping into the grown-up world. These agents

										more easily relate to our younger policyholders who

									are also digital natives like them.</p>

									<p>By engaging our millennial market in social

										media, our <span class="ital">“Magandang Araw”</span> brand campaign

										has now become a social movement: our young

										policyholders actively share how they choose

										positivity every day, and how it creates a ripple effect

									on the lives of people around them.</p>

									<h2 class="no-leading">What would be the biggest challenges for

									Insular Life and the insurance industry in 2017

									and the coming years?</h2>

									<p>Many industry players actually spent a great

										deal of time in 2016 preparing for a slew of new

										regulations. There were a lot of policy discussions on

										the adoption of international standards for capital

									and for insurance policy reserves.</p>

									<p>The Insurance Commission (IC), through

										Republic Act 10607 or the new Insurance Code,

										mandated that all existing insurance companies

										must increase their minimum net worth from

									&#8369;250 million to &#8369;550 million by December 31, 2016.</p>

									<p>As a mutual company, Insular Life’s capital is

										based on net worth, which at &#8369;43.9 billion as of

										end-2016 is more than enough to comply with the

										minimum capitalization requirement.

									</p>

									<p>Another challenge for many industry players is

										the new framework on Risk-Based Capital (RBC). This

										provides for the minimum amount of capital that an

										insurance company must have based on the risk it

										undertakes. This strengthens a company’s ability to

									withstand the volatilities in its environment.</p>

									<p>The new RBC requirement and the minimum

										capital requirement are concerns for many smaller

										industry players. Nevertheless, these are needed

										to bring the local insurance industry at par with its

									counterparts in neighboring countries.</p>

									<p>The regulatory environment in which we

										operate is constantly changing, and our customer

										demographic is changing as well. In 2017, we will

										have to be nimble to confront a marketplace that is

										undergoing dramatic transformation than perhaps

									ever before.</p>

									<p>We also have to anticipate potential challenges,

										for example, interest spikes from current historic

										lows. These hurdles, along with slowing global

										economies, could make it difficult for many insurers

										to generate the returns they need to attract and

									retain clients profitably.</p>

									<p>This kind of terrain, however, is no uncharted

										territory for a 106-year old institution like ours.

										Insular Life has a proven track record in adapting

										to rapidly evolving markets. As long as our

										culture remains customer-centric, innovative, and

										technology-driven, and we continue to remain true

										to our purpose, we are confident we can sustainably

										drive growth, bolster efficiency, improve customer

									experience, and head off emerging competition.</p>
