									<p class="big">Insular Life employees are united in their

										passion and commitment towards building a

										brighter future for our policyholders — ensuring

										that their investment continues to deliver

									enduring value for them and their family.</p>

									<p>With their skills and achievements, our employees are

										among Insular’s foundation of success. Beyond skills and

										achievements, they possess pride, loyalty, and motivation

										empowering them to make a positive difference to our

										stakeholders. This is the cornerstone of our human resource

									programs.</p>

									<h2>Employee force profile</h2>

									<p>As of end-2016, Insular Life has a regular employee force

										of 771 employees. This includes those in Insular’s head office

										in Alabang, Muntinlupa City, as well as in its 53 branch offices

										in key cities and provinces nationwide. The Company has

										475 female and 296 male personnel, which translates to a

										male-to-female ratio of 1:3. Of the total 771 employees,

										20.23 percent or 156, occupied senior personnel positions

										(assistant managers and up) in 2016. The average age of our

									employee force in 2016 was 36.52 years old.</p>

									<h2>Training & Development Programs</h2>

									<p>In 2016, a non-executive Insular Life employee spent an

										average of 75 hours in in-house and external training and

										development programs such as courses under the Life Office

									Management Office (LOMA).</p>

									<p>We use a blended approach in our internal training

										courses that includes workshops, coaching, and instructor-led

										training sessions, all designed and conducted among target

									participants across all units nationwide.</p>

									<p class="specialshttxt">The In-House Training Programs are classified as follows:</p>

									<h3 class="specialshth3">1. Customer Relations/Service Series</h3>

									<ul>

										<li>For All Employee Levels</li>

										<li>Addresses the need for general information and

										updates about the Company and its product lines</li>

										<li>The courses conducted under the series are: General

											Employee Orientation Course (GEOC); Fundamentals

											of Life Insurance Course (FLIC); and Product

										Orientations</li>

									</ul>

									<h3>2. Behavioral Program</h3>

									<ul>

										<li>For All Employee Levels</li>

										<li>Addresses the “soft issues” (customer relations and

											work attitude) requirements of the Magandang Araw

										Service Brand.</li>

										<li>The courses under the series are: Customer Care

											Seminar; Strengthening Personal Capability; and

										SHINE “Exuding the Magandang Araw Attitude.”</li>

									</ul>

									<h3>3. Basic Management/Supervisory Program</h3>

									<ul>

										<li>From Supervisory to Senior Manager Level</li>

										<li>Addresses the training needs of Middle Management

											and focuses on both introduction and application of

											basic management functions (planning, organizing,

											leading and controlling) and specific tools and

											techniques such as problem solving, and decision

										making</li>

										<li>The series include the following courses: Supervisory

											Management Course; Action-Centered Leadership;

											Coaching and Counseling Workshop; and Leadership:

										The Management of Change</li>

									</ul>

									<p>Insular employees were also sent to external training

										programs that addressed their needs for technical

										knowledge, and updated them on specific disciplines such

										as accounting, finance, investment, auditing, actuarial,

										underwriting, strategic marketing, information technology/

										specialized training, corporate trends/organizational

										development, technical training on building/real property

										administration and legislation, and statutorial guidelines

									affecting operations.</p>

									<p>A key focus of Insular Life’s training program is the

										Executive Development Program (EDP) in which key

										Company executives are sent to attend management courses

										here and abroad to facilitate their advancement from being a

										specialist to a generalist. In 2016, our executives attended an

									average of 18 EDP-related training courses.</p>

									<p>Leaders’ Symposium entitled, “Leading Change: Swift Shift

										to Success.” The symposium aimed to prepare the Total

										Management Team for the directions and challenges of

										business in the coming years. The event was headlined by

										a sought-after international speaker and senior executive

										coach, Mr. Roger Collantes. Members of Insular Life’s middle

									management and its officers attended the two-day event.</p>

									<p>Insular Life also extends scholarships to employees

										taking up courses under the Life Office Management

										Association (LOMA), an employee training and development

										association used by life insurance companies in over 70

										countries worldwide. Due to its commitment to the program,

										Insular Life has been a consistent recipient of the Excellence

										in Education Awards from LOMA in the past 15 years

									since 1992.</p>

									<p>We also developed a steady roster in the Fellow, Life

										Management Institute (FLMI), with 39 Fellows to date. The

										FLMI Program has been the standard of excellence in the

										insurance and financial services industry in the world

									since 1932.</p>

									<p>In addition, we also offer a scholarship program for

										employees who wish to pursue postgraduate degrees related

									to their job functions.</p>

									<h2 class="no-leading">Rewarding Performance and Loyalty</h2>

									<p>Being the leading Filipino life insurer in the country,

									Insular Life aims to be recognized as one of the best places to

									work. Thus, we take pride in providing a comprehensive and

									industry-competitive compensation and benefits package to all

									our employees. Moreover, we promote fair treatment and offer

									equal opportunities in all aspects of employment.</p>

									<p>The Company also provides variable bonuses, which are

									determined by Management upon attainment of the yearly

									Corporate Performance Index.</p>

									<p>Insular also offers a host of benefits, such as a housing

									loan that an employee can avail himself of after five years from

									date of permanency. Employees’ long years of loyal service are

									also rewarded by the Company through the Service Awards

									that are given every five years of continuous service.</p>

									<p>Under the Company’s Retirement Plan, Insular Life

									provides 150% of basic salary per year of service upon the

									employee’s optional retirement (at least 50 years old and

									20 years of service) or normal retirement (at age 65 and at least

									20 years of service). Likewise, the Company provides retirement

									token in the form of a luxury wrist watch to its qualified retirees.</p>

									<h2>Promoting Health and Safety</h2>

									<p>We recognize that our Company’s reputation as a forward looking

									guardian can only hold true if we can look after the

									health and welfare of our people. Thus, we have to promote

									a culture where health and safety is an integral part of every

									business decision across the organization.</p>

									<p>We offer free annual medical examination to our regular

									employees. In addition, we have a Company dentist who

									conducts dental check-ups for our employees and their

									dependents.</p>

									<p>Recognizing the importance of a healthy and active

									lifestyle, Insular Life actively supports sports tournaments for

									employees, such as basketball, badminton and bowling. In

									addition, we started a Health and Wellness program, through

									which we have organized fitness classes such as yoga and

									zumba at the Head Office.</p>

									<p>On a regular basis, we have a Company physician who

									sends out a “Health Bulletin” via email to the Insular Life

									community. It contains Department of Health advisories and

									circulars on relevant health issues, as well as health tips and

									preventive measures.</p>

									<p>Relevant information relating to the health, safety and

									welfare of our employees are regularly discussed during

									AGILA meetings. Issues raised during these meetings are

									validated and communicated to Management for information

									and resolution. Management, through HRD, issues formal

									communications — i.e. policies, guidelines or circulars —

									addressing critical issues.</p>

									<p>Our Building Management Office (BMO), through the

									supervision of the Real Property Division, also issues circulars

									on the regular preventive maintenance activities for our head

									office in ILCC Alabang, Insular Health Care Building-Makati,

									and Insular Life Cebu Business Centre. This ensures that our

									workplaces and facilities are maintained in good condition for

									the safety of our employees, the people we work with, and

									those exposed to our activities.</p>

									<h2>Moving Ahead with our People</h2>

									<p>For Insular Life’s growth strategy to work, we need our

									employees to believe in us. Thus, amid the toughening

									competition for talent in the insurance industry, we realize

									there are still areas where we can improve to sustain a high

									overall satisfaction level among our employees. As our journey

									to become an Employer of Choice continues, Insular Life

									will regard the development of human capital as the most

									important investment we can make for a successful future.</p>
