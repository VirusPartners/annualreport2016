									<h2 class="no-leading">Insular Health Care, Inc.</h2>

									<p>Insular Health Care, Inc. (IHCI) is one of the top ten

									health maintenance organizations (HMOs) in the Philippines

									in terms of capitalization, comprehensive healthcare

									packages and service delivery. IHCI offers one of the

									industry’s most comprehensive healthcare programs with

									the flexibility to meet the specific needs of its members.

									As of end of 2016, it maintains a network of 2,910 hospitals,

									outpatient facilities and dental clinics, and a roster of

									24,406 medical specialists nationwide.</p>

									<p>IHCI maintains a dynamic website with an online

									application function, a rate calculator that computes

									membership fees for individual and family accounts, and

									payment facilities. Also in the website are the on-going

									sales promos, a Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator, monthly

									medical articles, and an agent application facility. IHCI also

									utilizes a Short Messaging System (SMS) broadcast facility

									and email blast to communicate with members.</p>

									<p>IHCI recently launched its mobile application called

									Insular Health Care Mobile Assistant or IMA. With IMA,

									members have online access to their membership data, the

									updated list of doctors and hospitals/clinics (via a search

									engine), and regular health bulletins and membership

									updates through their smart mobile phones (Android and

									iOS). It also launched Insular Health Care Web Assist or

									IWA. Together with IMA, IWA enables the hospital staff to

									verify the status of each and every IHCI member online,

									minimizing the need for calls to the call center and thus

									providing faster and more efficient status verification. IHCI’s

									new membership ID with QR code capability is a convenient

									way of accessing the membership data, with IHCI equipping

									select hospitals with the QR code reader, with more

									accredited hospitals to be equipped in the near future.</p>

									<h2 class="no-leading">mapfre insular</h2>

									<p>MAPFRE INSULAR, today, ranks among the top 10 in

									the non-life insurance industry in terms of earned premiums,

									investment income, and net income. The company is also

									among the highest capitalized and most solvent in the

									non-life insurance business in the country. The company

									was formed out of an alliance between MAPFRE, a leading

									insurance company in Spain with more than 34 million clients

									worldwide and business activity in more than 100 countries

									and Insular Life Assurance Co., Ltd., the Philippines’ largest

									Filipino-owned insurer. </p>

									<h2>Highlights of Company’s Performance in 2016</h2>

									<p>The Company started 2016 with a sense of grit as it

									entered the second year of the massive transformation

									that MAPFRE INSULAR took in 2015. The plan was quite

									straightforward: MAFPRE INSULAR wanted sustainable

									growth and its formula for attaining this is to follow the

									hallmarks of solvency, integrity, innovation, and exceptional

									service that are standard in the global MAPFRE Group.</p>

									<p> But like many worthwhile changes, this brand of

									transformation required fortitude because, as the Company

									predicted early on, success will be paved with sacrifices.

									Investments must be made in technologies and people. In

									the same vein, the company had to turn its back on risky

									practices such as unrealistic competition, never mind the

									tempting easy gains, because these endanger not just the

									business but the welfare of customers.</p>

									<p> Despite this decision, however, MAPFRE INSULAR

									managed to post modest increase in sales, logging in

									P2.184 billion in gross premiums written in 2016, which is

									about 7 percent higher than 2015. Assets moved nearly

									sideways as the Company recorded P5.83 billion in assets

									as of end of 2016.</p>
