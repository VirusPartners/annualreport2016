									<p class="big">Insular Life is more than a business.

									We are a company with heart and soul.

									We care about young Filipinos who are the

									nation’s builders, investing in their future through

									educational scholarship grants and financial

									literacy programs. We also reach out to those in

									need by providing relief and rehabilitation during

									natural and man-made disasters.</p>

									<p>Through our corporate social responsibility arm,

									Insular Foundation, Inc., we are able to share our success

									with local communities and magnify our efforts through our

									highly engaged teams of employee volunteers.</p>

									<h2>Investing in Achievers</h2>

									<p>In 2016, we sustained our educational programs

									to create the next generation of Filipino achievers. The

									Foundation supported a total of 75 scholars for school

									year 2016-2017, 40 of whom were enrolled in education

									and math courses at the University of the Philippines, 23

									in education courses in provincial state universities and

									colleges (SUCs), and 12 under the College Scholarship for

									Employee Dependents (CSED) program.</p>

									<p>In the same school year, six Gold Eagle scholars

									graduated from UP with honors. Those who finished

									education courses are now gainfully employed as teachers,

									fulfilling the two-year service requirement under their

									scholarship, while three of our BS Math graduates <br/> (Robert

									Ronquillo, Shaira Acquiat, and Jessica Macanas) now work

									at Insular’s Actuarial Division.</p>

									<p>The CSED program produced one graduate, Adrian

									Joseph Lance M. Lim, a BS Commerce major in Marketing

									Management, now working at Insular’s Corporate

									Account Division.</p>

									<h2 class="no-leading">Making Quality Education Work</h2>

									<p>We believe that raising financial literacy is as

									important as providing access to education if we were

									to build a stronger nation. People armed with financial

									knowledge and healthy personal finances contribute to economic growth and society's wellbeing.</p>

									<p>Through our financial literary projects and initiatives,

									we spread positive money management values among

									the youth. Doing so also helps us secure the financial

									future of the next generation.</p>

									<p>A partnership that we started with the Knowledge

									Channel in 2015 continued to bear fruit. In 2016, Insular

									Life and the country’s first and only educational channel

									jointly launched a teacher’s manual and a financial

									literacy video for grade 9 students. The Estudyantipid

									Financial Literacy Video Episode for High School Araling

									Panlipunan was launched in Pitogo High School in Makati

									City on September 30, 2016.</p>

									<p>The 20-minute video tackled topics on the

									macroeconomics of earning, savings, and consumption.

									Its storyline focuses on three high school friends who

									think up ways to earn money and along the way stumbled

									on the importance of life insurance as an avenue to

									protect one’s family’s livelihood, as well as the various

									means to save and grow money.</p>

									<p>The video is accompanied by instructional materials

									for teachers to guide them on the money concepts for

									classroom discussions. Starring actors Jairus Aquino,

									Sharlene San Pedro, Joaquin Reyes, and Dea Chua,

									the Estudyantipid video airs nationwide on Knowledge

									Channel through cable, satellite, and digital terrestrial

									system (DTT), and are made available to students

									and teachers in Knowledge Channel-connected

									public schools and cable- or DTT-serviced homes.

									It was integrated in the 2nd semester SY 2016-2017

									Araling Palipunan lessons of grade 9 students, and will

									become part of the regular educational tools for the

									said grade level. Another episode of Estudyantipid

									will be completed by June 2017 and launched shortly

									afterwards.</p>

								<h2 class="no-leading">Giving and getting involved</h2>

									<p>We at Insular take great pride in having employees

									who generously share their talent, time, and compassion

									with others. Our employees amplify the impact of

									our CSR initiatives by serving as volunteers in local

									communities or giving to charitable causes and

									nonprofits. Insular embraces their enthusiasm to help

									make a difference.</p>

									<p>Below are just a few of the many ways we are able

									to make a positive impact in society through our highly

									engaged employee volunteers:</p>

								<ul>

									<li>Insular Foundation sustained its ties with nonprofit

									anti-poverty movement Gawad Kalinga (GK) with

									the continued value-formation sessions conducted

									by our employee-volunteers for the children at the

									Manggahan-Kawayanan Village in Parañaque City.</li>

									<li>Eighty SAGIP kids of GK-Manggahan were treated to

									a Christmas party on December 17, 2016. Seventeen

									employee-volunteers organized the free movie

									screening sponsored by Insular Foundation and which

									was held at the Insular Life cafeteria. The kids enjoyed

									plenty of treats: from the various food booths on-site

									to the Christmas loot bags and presents they

									brought home.</li>

									<li>Employee-volunteers successfully conducted an

									outreach activity at the Hospicio de San Jose on

									April 30, 2016. They raised cash donations from Insular

									Life employees which were used to purchase healthy

									food, sacks of rice, and toiletries for 55 abandoned

									and neglected elderlies at the hospice.</li>

									<li>Seventy-nine scholars from Muntinlupa Itaas

									Elementary School (MIES) in the National Bilibid

									Prison Complex in Muntinlupa City will graduate from

									grade school in March 2017. School year 2016-2017

									was the last year of our Adopt-A-Scholar program

									in which our employee volunteers provided school

									supplies, a set of uniform, and a school bag to their

									adopted scholars.</li>

									</ul>

									<p>In addition, several Insular Life officers and

									employees raised more donations to benefit the school’s

									Special Education Department, and the top three

									scholars for SY 2015-2016.</p>

									<p>The Foundation gave a cash donation to MIES

									in support of the Department of Education’s Brigada

									Eskwela Program. The amount enabled the repair and

									refurbishment of classrooms in preparation for the school

									opening last June 2016.</p>

									<h2>Other Financial Assistance</h2>

									<p class="strong">Television sets for the PMA</p>

									<p>To support the education of our future officers in

									the Armed Forces of the Philippines, Insular Foundation

									and the World Financial Marketing Alliance, Inc. donated

									television sets to the Philippine Military Academy (PMA).</p>

									<p class="strong">St. Ignatius Loyola Movie Block Screening</p>

									<p>Insular sponsored the block screening of “Ignacio

									de Loyola,” a full-length independent feature film about

									St. Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Society of Jesus.

									Proceeds were donated to Jesuits Communications and

									retired Jesuit priests in need of care and assistance.</p>

									<p class="strong">Caritas Manila</p>

									<p>Through Caritas Manila, the charity arm of the

									Archdiocese of Manila, Insular Foundation provided

									rebuilding assistance to those affected by Typhoon Ferdie

									(Meranti) in Batanes in September 2016. The disaster

									affected 2,850 families and damaged numerous homes in

									the northernmost province of the country.</p>

									<p class="strong">Rebuilding Efforts</p>

									<p>Through the Philippine Business for Social Progress

									(PBSP), we donated 10 shelter kits and 100 sphere food

									packs for relief and rehabilitation efforts for the victims of

									Typhoon Lawin.</p>

									<p class="strong">Moving Forward</p>

									<p>In 2016, we will continue to provide financial assistance

									to more deserving but financially disadvantaged students

									through our scholarship programs while we strengthen the

									systems and procedures governing our scholarship grants

									to SUCs.</p>

									<p>We also look forward to the completion of our

									classroom building in San Jose Central Elementary School

									and San Jose Technical School in San Jose, Northern

									Samar, where construction began last December 2016.

									Both schools were among those heavily damaged during

									Typhoon Nona on December 17, 2015.</p>

									<p>While working to help build a better and more

									sustainable world, Insular Life will continue fostering a

									corporate culture that values CSR, pursuing initiatives that

									will help improve access to quality education, as well as

									rebuilding and uplifting lives.</p>

									<h2>What made you volunteer for the GK program?</h2>

									<p class="name"><strong>Nicolo Lorenzo T. Cervantes, 28 years old, Public Relations

									Staff / Archives.</strong> Looking back when I was a kid, I always

									appreciated the work done by volunteers for similar

									programs to GK SAGIP, or even the catechists in our

									Sunday school. As a graduate of a state university, I also

									felt that I should take opportunities to render service to

									communities in need of similar programs. For the most

									part, I started volunteering for GK because I felt I had a

									personal responsibility to try to give back whatever skills

									I gained when I was younger.</p>

									<p class="name"><strong>Adrian C. Cailao, 30 years old, Corporate Planning Staff.</strong> I have

									always wanted to do this kind of volunteer work as a means

									of giving back to the community. I used to join outreach

									activities when I was in college.</p>

									<p class="name"><strong>Juan Paolo A. Llantero, 21 years old, Policyholders Services Division. </strong>Volunteering for an outreach program like GK gave me the chance

									to try something that I don’t experience every day — perhaps, a

									chance to help and have an impact on someone else’s life.</p>

									<p class="name"><strong>Gimelson Y. Plaza, 24 years old, Policyholders Services Division.</strong> It is a

									great way to express and share your talents and to show care for

									others, like kids.</p>

									<p class="name"><strong>Gester E. Camalig, 28 years old, Information Services Department. </strong>I joined the GK program because it offers vital help to people

									and communities in need, and support for worthwhile causes.

									Volunteering is good for the mind and body, and brings fun and

									fulfillment to my life.</p>

									<p class="name"><strong>Michelle Anne B. Casibang, 24 years old, Public Relations Staff /

									Insular Foundation, Inc..</strong> I have done outreach activities in the

									past. However, those activities were already pre-planned and,

									so, I only needed to show up. With this program, I am able to be

									part of a team that could make a bigger difference. Instead of just

									being present, I have the chance to be proactive.</p>

									<p class="name"><strong>Rachel M. Fernandez, 27 years old, Marketing and Agency Support

									Services Division.</strong> Volunteering takes me out of my daily life. It

									is my passion to help other people. It feels good inside that I

									am giving unconditionally, and satisfying that I am able to help

									people. I have a soft heart, especially for kids, the elderly, and

									those in need.</p>

									<p class="name"><strong>Daniela Rose H. Abuel, 23 years old, Policyholders Services Division.</strong>The reason why I volunteer is to de-stress after a week of work.

									I also want to give back to the community while developing my

									social skills, and, at the same time, to gain new experience. Being

									a volunteer gives me the satisfaction that I was able to play a

									role in, and get to see how my contribution has made a positive

									impact in the lives of the children of GK Manggahan-Kawayanan.</p>

									<!-- <h2>What's the most fulfilling aspect of being a volunteer?</h2>

									<p class="big bordered wow bounceInLeft"><span>Nico:</span> The most satisfying aspect to me is seeing the

									kids grow up and start to become responsible

									on their own. At the end of the day, it’s really

									about them and how they grow into the

									world. I’d like to believe that we had a part

									in their development as young men and

									women, cognizant of their talents that can

									be put to good use.</p>

									<p class="convo-name"><span>Adri:</span> It’s the warm welcome of our beneficiaries every volunteer

									session. The GK kids make us feel fulfilled in this kind

									of activity. This warmth gives us excitement to conduct

									more volunteer sessions. </p>

									<p class="convo-name">Every session is a new opportunity for sharing what we

									have and what we can to others. It is also an avenue for

									us volunteers to help the community in nation building,

									by imparting what is right to young minds. Every session

									offers new learnings and appreciation of the things

									that we have: a new unique experience. This keeps our

									passion for volunteering burning.</p>

									<p class="convo-name"><span>Paolo:</span> Being a volunteer gives me a sense of satisfaction. It

									really warms my heart to see the kids having fun playing

									and learning and with the thought that someday, those

									kids will apply everything they’ve learned.</p>

									<p class="convo-name"><span>Gester:</span> The most fulfilling aspect of being a volunteer is that it

									provides a sense of purpose.</p>

									<p class="convo-name"><span>Mitzie:</span> The laughter and smile of the kids, their warm welcome

									and thanks. The fact that they are always willing to help

									out. When you realize that you made a difference, even

									in the littlest way. The fact that all the hard work has

									paid off. The payoff is often not concrete, but it’s there

									nonetheless. These make everything worthwhile.</p>

									<p class="convo-name"><span>Rachel:</span> At the end of the day, even though you are tired, it will

									bring a smile to your face. You will be able to say to

									yourself, “I did well today. I helped someone. I made

									them smile.” </p>

									<p class="convo-name"><span>Dani:</span> I’ve been with Insular Foundation for more than a year.

									In this time, I have developed my self-confidence and

									self-esteem. I am also able to further improve these

									skills in every volunteering activity we have during our

									monthly sessions. More than that, working as part of a

									team outside your ordinary work routine allows you

									to connect with your colleagues in a fun and

									meaningful way. </p>

									<h2>Could you name one activity that made a lasting impact on you

									and briefly tell us why?</h2>

									<p class="convo-name"><span>Nico: </span>During the Christmas party in December, I read a letter

									from one of the GK kids that thanked the volunteers for

									playing and becoming friends with them. Those were

									things that never occurred to me. Volunteering is actual

									work, but I really do believe that the kids appreciate the

									time and activities we share with them. And apparently,

									it includes the heart we put in our efforts as well.</p>

									<p class="convo-name"><span>Adri: </span>It was the visit to the elderlies of Hospicio de San Jose

									during the Foundation’s anniversary in April 2016. After

									the event, when we were assisting the elders to their

									quarters, one of them gave me a handcrafted rosary

									bracelet as a sign of appreciation and said, “Salamat sa

									inyo. Mag-iingat kayo.” That moment reminds me of the

									selflessness of the elder, that even though she does

									not have much, she still managed to share something

									with others. </p>

									<p class="convo-name"><span>Paolo: </span>

									My first time to attend a GK program was during the

									anniversary celebration at Hospicio de San Jose. What

									struck me the most was seeing the elderly people living

									the simplest lives possible. Some of them still remember

									their lives before they stayed there. From them, I realized

									that our time is so limited that we have to make every

									moment count.</p>

									<p class="convo-name"><span>Gimel: </span>Not the specific activity but the topic for the month of

									March 2017: “Respect.” I realized that kids learn how

									to respect other people not only from their parents, but

									also from us, the volunteers.</p>

									<p class="convo-name"><span>Gester: </span>One activity that made a lasting impact to me was the

									Hospicio De San Jose outreach. The stories of the elders

									were very heartfelt. They used to be like us. They are

									parents and grandparents but they found themselves

									with another family inside the institution. To conquer

									their sadness, they always find ways to be happy. They

									sing, dance, and talk just like everything is all right.

									I admire their strength and fortitude; in spite of their

									conditions, they choose to be happy.</p> -->

									<p class="convo-name"><span>Mitzie: </span>The Hospicio de San Jose outreach program really

									solidified that there are people out there with far worst

									problems. It was refreshing to see the kids interact

									with the elderly residents. It goes to show that, even if

									there was a generation gap, it did not hinder anyone

									from enjoying and contributing to the encounter. The

									kids are not well off nor do they have a big capacity to

									provide too much. However, this did not stop them from

									going the extra mile. They all helped out, joined in the

									activities, and even performed a special number for the

									elderlies. This goes to show that people really have a

									big heart. </p>

									<p class="convo-name"><span>Rachel: </span>Our 4th year anniversary where we spent it in Hospicio

									de San Jose with the GK Kids was impactful. I was

									worried at first because the kids may hurt the feelings

									of the elderly residents: they are quiet sensitive to what

									people say and kids often cannot control what they say.

									I also feared that the children might be too energetic.

									I was proven wrong. The kids were very careful and

									empathetic. Seeing that made me feel that we did well.

									The lessons we were teaching the kids in our Saturday

									sessions were showcased during the event.</p>

									<h2>How has volunteerism changed your perspective in life?</h2>

									<p class="convo-name"><span>Nico: </span>To say that volunteering has made me more patient

									and forgiving is an understatement.</p>

									<p class="convo-name bordered-orange big wow bounceInRight"><span>Adri: </span>It opened my perspective that we have

									to be more compassionate with each

									other. We have to be concerned about our

									fellowmen and to not stop helping and

									lending a hand even through small acts of

									goodness. Volunteerism showed me that

									if there’s a will (to help others and to share

									your blessings), there really is a way. </p>

									<p class="convo-name"><span>Paolo: </span>I am always a fan of hope. Hope that someday

									something will be meaningful and will have an impact

									on the largest group of people possible. Those kids

									have every chance in the world to become what they

									want to be. And as a volunteer, somehow I have the

									responsibility in contributing to that.</p>

									<p class="convo-name bordered wow bounceInLeft"><span>Gimel: </span>

									I thought it was going to be hard for me to deal

									with vigorous kids especially since it was my first

									time to participate in a volunteerism activity that is

									focused on children. During the sessions, however, I

									discovered that I was having a great time interacting

									with them. I also learned a lot from them about good

									communication, respect, unity and many other things.

									</p>

									<p class="convo-name wow bounceInRight"><span>Gester: </span>Volunteerism helped shape my heart, mind and soul.

									That is, seeing a completely new way of life helped

									me develop a more well-rounded perspective of the

									world. Witnessing the struggles of others also helped

									me realign my priorities and gain a more positive

									outlook in life. </p>

									<p class="convo-name bordered-orange wow bounceInLeft"><span>Mitzie: </span>

									There’s always someone out there who needs help.

									It is up to us if we want to do anything about it.

									We cannot tackle all the world’s problems at once.

									But, whatever that we can do, we should do it

									wholeheartedly and with no regrets. Volunteering is

									about all giving back. What a volunteer gets in return

									is the warmth and happiness from the beneficiary/ies.

									</p>

									<p class="convo-name big bordered wow bounceInRight"><span>Rachel: </span>It made me, in a way,

									optimistic. I changed from

									being self-centered to finding

									my passion in helping others.

									It made me realize that, no

									matter how difficult life is,

									there is still something

									I can give.</p>

													<p>During the Christmas party in December, I read a letter

													from one of the GK kids that thanked the volunteers for

													playing and becoming friends with them. Those were

													things that never occurred to me. Volunteering is actual

													work, but I really do believe that the kids appreciate the

													time and activities we share with them. And apparently,

													it includes the heart we put in our efforts as well.

													<p>It was the visit to the elderlies of Hospicio de San Jose

													during the Foundation’s anniversary in April 2016. After

													the event, when we were assisting the elders to their

													quarters, one of them gave me a handcrafted rosary

													bracelet as a sign of appreciation and said, “Salamat sa

													inyo. Mag-iingat kayo.” That moment reminds me of the

													selflessness of the elder, that even though she does

													not have much, she still managed to share something

													<p>The Hospicio de San Jose outreach program really

													solidified that there are people out there with far worst

													there was a generation gap, it did not hinder anyone

													from enjoying and contributing to the encounter. The

													kids are not well off nor do they have a big capacity to

													provide too much. However, this did not stop them from

													going the extra mile. They all helped out, joined in the

													activities, and even performed a special number for the

													elderlies. This goes to show that people really have a

													big heart. </p>

									<h2>How has volunteerism affected your perspective

																	<p class="convo-name"><span>Nico: </span>Volunteering has made me more persistent and

									diligent in my work. This is important to me personally

									as I work in the Archives. I am reminded that what I

									am doing is as much about the future as it is about

									the past.</p>

									<p class="convo-name"><span>Adri: </span>Volunteerism made me grateful to our Company for

									this opportunity to participate. Insular management

									is also very supportive of the activities that we do in

									Insular Foundation</p>

									<p class="convo-name"><span>Paolo: </span>I met a lot of new faces at work because of being

									a volunteer. It also made me conscious about my

									actions, in work and life, because I know the kids look

									at me as a role model. So I try to be the ‘Kuya’ that

									they can emulate.</p>

									<p class="convo-name"><span>Gimel: </span>Volunteerism gave me a new perspective in work and

									in my career. For example, our GK children can think

									really fast! They could come up with a presentation

									in just 15 minutes! They are using their broad minds

									to create ideas and properly coordinate with each

									other. So I think, how could those little children do

									those things? As a young professional, it challenges

									me to be the same and apply their flexibility, creativity,

									cooperation and speed in my work!</p>

									<p class="convo-name bordered-orange wow bounceInLeft"><span>Gester: </span>Because of volunteerism, I gained leadership skills,

									explored and learned things beyond my horizon, and

									accepted challenges.</p>

									<p class="convo-name"><span>Mitzie: </span>I learned that patience is a big thing in everything

									a person does. There are different types of people

									whom we deal with each day. Adapting to the

									situation is crucial in order to accomplish a task.</p>

									<p class="convo-name"><span>Rachel: </span>Volunteerism strengthened my self-confidence. It

									boosted my level of understanding for my co-workers

									and consequently, strengthened our team work.</p>

									<h2>Why should we volunteer?</h2>

									<p class="convo-name"><span>Adri: </span>A little compassion can go a long way. If we can and

									we are able, let us share it with those with less and

									those who are not capable. No matter how small, if

									everyone contributes, our combined small acts will

									have a huge impact.</p>

									<p class="convo-name big bordered wow bounceInRight"><span>Paolo: </span>Being a volunteer will not take

									your time. Instead, it will give you

									the time to have a different kind of

									happiness and perspective on

									your life.</p>

									<p class="convo-name"><span>Gester: </span>Professionally, we can share a skill and gain a skill as

									well, just like leadership and commitment. Personally,

									we can get to know a community; feel satisfaction

									from accomplishing things; learn something new; be

									challenged; and make new friends.</p>

									<p class="convo-name"><span>Mitzie: </span>Volunteering gives a different kind of fulfillment. It will

									make you feel proud, and accomplished. It may not

									seem like it at first but a person’s time can make

									a difference.</p>

									<p class="convo-name big bordered wow bounceInRight"><span>Dani: </span>I volunteer because I can, and if you

									could do something to help, then

									you should. That’s my mantra in

									volunteering and what’s what keeps

									me going.</p>

									<h2>How has volunteerism affected your perspective

																	<p class="convo-name"><span>Nico: </span>Volunteering has made me more persistent and

									diligent in my work. This is important to me personally

									as I work in the Archives. I am reminded that what I

									am doing is as much about the future as it is about

									the past.</p>

									<p class="convo-name"><span>Adri: </span>Volunteerism made me grateful to our Company for

									<h2>Why should we volunteer?</h2>

									<p class="convo-name"><span>Adri: </span>A little compassion can go a long way. If we can and

									we are able, let us share it with those with less and

									those who are not capable. No matter how small, if

									everyone contributes, our combined small acts will

									have a huge impact.</p>

									<p class="convo-name big bordered wow bounceInRight"><span>Paolo: </span>Being a volunteer will not take

									your time. Instead, it will give you

									the time to have a different kind of

									happiness and perspective on

									your life.</p>

									<p class="convo-name"><span>Gester: </span>Professionally, we can share a skill and gain a skill as

									well, just like leadership and commitment. Personally,

									we can get to know a community; feel satisfaction

									from accomplishing things; learn something new; be

									challenged; and make new friends.</p>

									<p class="convo-name"><span>Mitzie: </span>Volunteering gives a different kind of fulfillment. It will

									make you feel proud, and accomplished. It may not

									seem like it at first but a person’s time can make

									a difference.</p>

									<p class="convo-name big bordered wow bounceInRight"><span>Dani: </span>I volunteer because I can, and if you

									could do something to help, then

									you should. That’s my mantra in

									volunteering and what’s what keeps

									me going.</p>
