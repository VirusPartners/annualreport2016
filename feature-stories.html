									<h2>Transitioning</h2>

									<p>The tragic situation and even the words of comfort

									proved too heavy for Angel’s young mind to bear. After

									all, she was only beginning to discover her love for sports,

									ride a bicycle, and learn to play with younger sister Halle

									May who usually bonded more with their Dad.</p>

									<p>She was also only just beginning to enjoy her time

									with her Dad at that time. “We watched movies and

									made fun of other people together,” Angel recalls with a

									chuckle. “We had the same taste in music. I love going on

									road trips with him because of the music in the car. Dad

									would tap the steering wheel, and I’d be shouting out the

									lyrics,” Angel relates.</p>

									<p>Sports became Angel’s edge over her sister in their

									playful contest for Dad’s affections. He loved sports, too,

									and she was the athletic type who took taekwondo and

									swimming lessons. They also had typical father-and-child

									talks late at night, where he teased her about crushes but

									took her side during petty misunderstandings with Mom.</p>

									<p>Her father managed their family business that

									entailed frequent travels to neighboring Surigao City so

									he managed to stay with his family only once a month.

									Her mother took care of the kids while running a sari-sari

									store that sold rice and general merchandise. Every year,

									their parents would take their two daughters to vacations

									in Bantayan Island in Cebu, Siargao Island, and other

									sunny destinations.</p>

									<p>Death has a way of changing things, however. She

									remembers that after her Dad’s untimely passing, her

									mother, Lemia, shut down the small store because of its

									sheer proximity to the site of the incident. Angel recounts

									that although she and her sister did not see their mother, they knew that she cried every night in bed, not only due

									to the loss, but because she feared what lies ahead for

									the three of them without her husband around.</p>

									<p>Flashback to 2002, a few days after Michael Angelo

									and Lemia’s wedding: the couple was introduced by a

									family friend to life insurance. Shortly after the occasion,

									Angel’s father bought individual life insurance policies for

									him and his wife, not mindful of the added strain on the

									family budget.</p>

									<p>“Mom did not know insurance at the time. But my

									Dad’s friend, Tito Marlon Panganiban, had been our

									angel all along for bring Dad to this path,” Angel shares.</p>

									<p>She thought of her parents as frugal, financially firm,

									and determined. They satisfied some of their children’s

									wants, but they prioritized needs and investments. “We

									knew there was a limit to what could be given to us.”</p>

									<p>When it came to financial discipline, their parents

									taught Angel and Halle three things: prioritize useful and

									necessary things, be responsible in handling money, and

									save up for the future. “They taught us to be responsible

									in handling money. When we’re given money, we’re given

									came from my parents’ hard work,” Angel explains.</p>

									accompanied by relatives and her agent, she filed for

									already took care of the family’s needs that she no longer

									needed to reopen her small store or seek employment.

									She could be a full-time mom without worrying about the

									family’s finances.</p>

									<p>There were minor debts and obligations to be

									fulfilled, Angel recalls, but there was the insurance as well

									as uncles and aunts who willingly lent a hand.</p>

									<p>“Proceeds from the life insurance allowed us to stay

									together as a family. My sister and I still continue studying

									in the same school, doing our Kumon lessons. I’d like to

									think that we soldiered on pretty well,” Angel says.</p>

									<p class="title">Expecting <span>the Unexpected</span></p>

									<p class="head-text indent">2016 was no ordinary year. Even

									the most savvy investor could not help

									but feel queasy with the many swings

									in the global economy, and the varying

									ups and downs in the capital markets.</p>

									<p class="indent mobile-text">As early as January, news about China’s economic

									meltdown, slumping oil prices, and depreciating currencies

									has already jolted the financial markets. Uncertainty over the

									outcome of the presidential elections here and abroad also

									made investors sit on the sidelines.

									As investors rushed to find safer havens, the “Brexit”

									vote came and shocked many investors who had been

									confident that the United Kingdom would stay in the

									European Union.</p>

									<p class="indent mobile-text">The sharp market swings were then

									followed by the surprise election of real estate mogul Donald

									Trump as America’s next president, which triggered a U.S.

									bonds selloff. And just when investors thought the rollercoaster

									ride was about to break for a stop, the US Federal

									Reserve raised interest rates and announced it expected

									three more increases in 2017, derailing altogether the road

									for a much-hoped reprieve in the coming year. </p>

								</div>

								<div class="story-body">

									<h2>Steady course</h2>

									<p>2016 just happened to be the Year of the Monkey in the

									Chinese lunar calendar, and aptly so. The market volatility

									threw a monkey wrench into investing plans, and even

									investors with steady nerves ended up with twitchy palms.</p>

																		<p>It is this kind of market environment, however, that

									separates the men from the boys, so to speak. In the case of

									insurance companies, discipline, experience, and agility

									matter a lot. </p>

																		<p>Traditionally, insurers are considered to be bastions of

									security; they hold conservative assets such as fixed-income

									securities and corporate bonds. They survive on premiums,

									and thrive on float. By making wise investment decisions,

									they are able to generate suitable returns for the long term

									that would benefit their policyholders.</p>

									<p>If 2016 held an important lesson for insurers and

									investors, however, it is that the ability to survive the volatility

									is just as important as making the right investment.</p>

									<p>“We are really more into fundamental investing based on

									value and growth. As a life insurance company, our policies

									are long term, and that’s something we need to match. Our

									thrust ever since has been conservative,” said Vera Victoria

									C. Morales, first vice-president and head of the Investment

									Management Division (IMD) of Insular Life. For decades now,

									this conservatism has enabled the 106-year-old company

									to ride out bouts of volatilities and profit from staying

									the course.</p>

									<p>The IMD ensures optimum yields for the Company’s

									traditional investment portfolio, as well as recurring income

									and revenue stream. The Division also manages the various

									variable funds under the Insular Wealth Series of Funds, and

									develops investment-linked products in collaboration with

									other business units of the Company</p>

									<p>To be effective in its role, the IMD performs disciplined

									investment risk management to guide its investment

									decisions. It also ensures that its backroom operations remain

									strong to maintain the efficient delivery of all administrative

									requirements. </p>

									<p class="indent mobile-text">In 2016, Insular’s investment mettle was again put to the

									test.</p>

								</div>

								<div class="story-body">

									<p> With the Company’s total traditional investment portfolio

									under its management growing by almost 30 percent to

									&#8369;92.3 billion from 2015 of &#8369;71.1 billion, with fixed income

									assets comprising 56 percent of the portfolio, IMD has indeed

									shown that knowing the markets pays. </p>

									<p>Its traditional investment portfolio — comprised of

									money market, term loans, bonds, mortgage loans, and stock

									investments —generated &#8369;7.2 billion in gross income (inclusive

									of realized gains), an increase of almost 89 percent over the

									previous year. </p>

									<p>This is also reflected in the strong performance of Insular’s

									Wealth Series funds. Among the seven funds the Company

									manages, the Growth Fund posted the highest return at

									4.04 percent, followed by the Equity Fund at 3.21 percent. The

									Balanced Fund, a mixed exposure of equity and fixed-income

									assets, also delivered a respectable return of 2.64 percent.

									As of end-2016, the total value of the VUL funds has reached

									&#8369;21.2 billion</p>

									<p>“The peso funds outperformed the market in general,”

									said Ms. Morales. The performance of these funds benefited

									policyholders of Insular Life’s Wealth Builder, Variable Returns

									Asset, Wealth Assure and Wealth Secure, including its

									packages of Wealth Secure Education, Wealth Secure Prime

									and Wealth Assure Education.</p>

									<p>“Through it all, most investors of Insular Life’s variable unit

									linked (VUL) funds held on and were rewarded by very decent

									returns.” Insular Life’s VUL products provide life insurance

									protection while building up for future family expenditures

									related to education, retirement and estate planning.</p>

									<h2 class="no-leading">Making the movie</h2>

									<p>Asked if the Company has an investing “secret” for its

									stellar performance in 2016, Alan Joseph S. Amador, vice

									president at Insular Life’s IMD, said: “We did not do anything

									special. When the market went up, we took profits and

									shifted the proceeds to money market positions. When the

									market went down, we cost-averaged by buying back into

									our core positions.”</p>

									<p> For equities, choosing underlying investments with

									care is one of the biggest challenges. “We choose an

									investment based on its fundamentals, growth, and value;

									we basically juggle the three. So whatever opportunity

									is available, we seize it. But the stock’s liquidity is equally

									important as it reflects market interest in the company.</p>

									<p> If a company has good fundamentals but lacks liquidity (i.e.,

									hardly traded), then we might just end up holding a sizeable

									investment without anyone willing to take it from our hands.

									For managers that are always monitoring the market, it’s

									quite easy to see which stocks to pick because the pool of

									companies that are liquid is small. Since we go long, we just

									focus on these stocks,” said Mr. Amador.</p>

									<p> For bond investments, “we are generally exposed to

									Republic of the Philippines credit and bonds issued by prime

									rated local corporations. For an actively traded fund, bonds

									with ready entry and exit levels are the most preferred as

									prices of these securities are most of the time reflective of

									the market. A deep capital market is key to have more liquid

									fixed income securities trade in the market,” added Ruth R.

									Velasco, senior assistant vice president of Insular Life.</p>

									<p>Having the means to employ one’s investing strategy is

									another guideline that fund managers must bear in mind.

									“The trick is having a plan and to have the patience and

									discipline to execute that strategy. Make sure that you have

									the funds to deploy when the time comes to enter the

									market,” said Mr. Amador. “It helps that we have a steady

									stream of new investors who provide the fresh flows, and we

									have to credit our sales team for this,” added Ms. Morales.</p>

									<p>Investors must also listen closely to the market and be

									quick and nimble. </p>

									<p>“Before the local elections, there was some selling

									pressure, but we stayed on where we invested and did not

									join the bandwagon. Uncertainties always happen during

									elections — you don’t know who’s going to win. So true

									enough, after the elections, the Philippines’ economic

									fundamentals remained strong, and there was market

									recovery after. The noise came afterwards from external

									events, so we took the opportunity to rebalance some of our

									positions. So when the market went down, we were not as

									affected. That’s why we were able to post decent returns,”

									said Ms. Velasco.</p>

									<p>Another fundamental rule that the IMD experts keep to

									heart is not getting easily distracted by short-term incidents

									or events; rather, to focus on the merits of the investment. “If

									we believe that a company can ride out the storm, we buy its

									stock so we don’t veer away from our philosophy of investing

									in long-term value,” said Mr. Amador. </p>

										<p class="indent mobile-text">“For fixed income, we focus on local and global factors

										that affect movements in interest rates. As financial markets

										have become more interrelated, developments outside of

										the Philippines have greatly influenced the level of onshore

										interest rates,” said Ms. Velasco.</p>

										<p class="indent mobile-text">It helps to stay the course and keep abreast of

										developments here and abroad, particularly nowadays when

										“there are so many uncertainties causing volatilities in the

										market which provide opportunities to fund managers like us,”

										said Ms. Morales.</p>

										<p class="indent mobile-text">Whenever uncertainty grips the markets, the best

										course is to stay vigilant. “Clients now monitor their fund’s

										performance, and compare them not just among VULs, but

										against mutual funds and UITFs. </p>

										<p class="indent mobile-text">For 2017, investors have

										so many things to watch out for: one is the interest rate

										movement. For bonds, the magnitude of the U.S. Federal

										Reserve rate hikes will dictate the movement of local interest

										rates,” said Ms. Velasco. </p>

									</div>

								<div class="story-body">

									<p>“The equities market will also look at interest rates;

									when rates go higher, there would be a shift of fund flows

									from equities to bonds and this could create ripple effects on

									specific sectors as well,” said Mr. Amador. “The process of

									investing is really long term. If you are only looking at price

									movements, that’s speculating.”</p>

																		<p>Which brings home the point that when it comes to

									nurturing one’s hard-earned money, the smart move is to leave

									the investing to the experts.</p>

																		<p>“When you do your own investing, you always have the

									tendency to panic. It’s difficult to keep your emotions in check

									when you are dealing with your personal money. So we keep

									telling investors that it is better to leave the fund management

									to our team because we have already developed the discipline

									to stay the course and focus on our objectives,” said Ms.

									Morales. “For our VUL funds, the insurance wrapper is a

									further safeguard because our policyholders know that the life

									insurance on their policy is intact even when the markets are

									down,” she added. </p>

									<p>And with over a decade of successful track record in fund

									management, Insular’s IMD surely knows how to get to the

									path to profitability without guesswork. </p>

									<p class="head-text indent">The prime spot where Ayala Avenue

									intersects with Paseo de Roxas at the heart of

									Makati City is set to witness the rebirth of a

									historic icon this year.</p>

									<p class="indent mobile-text">After nearly two years since groundbreaking, the

									14-storey Insular Life Makati Building is set to reopen 20,779

									square meters of premium leasable area.</p>

									<p class="indent mobile-text">The iconic building

									was one of the first high-rise structures in the 1960s and has

									served as silent witness to more than 50 years of evolution of

									the country’s premier financial hub in the 1960s. </p>

									<p class="indent mobile-text">The much-awaited completion of the historical

									landmark’s redevelopment is good news, not only to Insular

									Life, but to policyholders as well. And one of those brimming

									with much excitement is Hector Caunan, Vice President and

									Head of Real Property Division at Insular Life.</p>

								</div>

								<div class="story-body">

									<p>“We plan to lease out 100 percent of the Insular Life

									Makati Building by the end of 2017, with a projected

									300 percent increase in leasing rates from pre-renovation

									prices, to be at par with industry standards. We expect to

									earn around &#8369;270 million once the building is 100 percent

									occupied by next year. But even with its current 30 percent

									occupancy rate as of March 2017 due pre-commitment lease

									negotiations, we already expect to earn &#8369;57 million this

									year,” Mr. Caunan said.</p>

									<h2>Setting the bar high</h2>

									<p>If the Insular Life Makati Building is any reflection of its

									106-year old owner, it is the fact that it is being reinvented as

									a modern and environmentally sustainable structure that also

									pays homage to its half-a-century heritage. </p>

									<p>Aiming to be Gold LEED-certified by the U.S. Green

									Building Council, the new building features a high-ceiling,

									semi-grand lobby, brand-new air-conditioning system,

									generators, elevators and lobby escalators, a 300-seater

									ballroom/multi-purpose hall on the 12th floor, and a new fivestorey,

									142-slot parking building at the back. It will also be

									home to the state-of-the-art iLearn Academy on the

									mezzanine floor. </p>

									<p>In a first-of-its-kind engagement in the country, Insular

									Life harnessed the combined expertise and network of

									Colliers International and KMC-Savills to bring the renovated

									main building to target leasing clients. The country’s leading

									universal banks, a newly opened Canadian fast food chain,

									alongside other high-value business processing outsourcing

									(BPO) firms and multinational corporations are just some of the

									prestigious entities poised to occupy the redeveloped space.

									<h2 class="no-leading">Riding the wave</h2>

									<p class="indent mobile-text">If Insular Life’s bottom line is to hit escape velocity in

									2017, expect the Real Property Division (RPD) to serve as its

									rocket fuel. In addition to leasing out space in the new IL </p>

									<p class="mobile-text" style="font-family: 'maven_proregular';">Makati building, the Division is also managing all Insular Life

									buildings, lands, and real estate assets from north to south

									to reap more value for the Company, and ultimately, for its

									policyholders.</p>

									<p class="indent mobile-text">Mr. Caunan said Insular currently has 22 buildings

									nationwide, all strategically located in every major city in the

									Philippines.</p>

									<p class="indent mobile-text">RPD ensures the proper maintenance of these

									workplaces and facilities, not only to provide a productive

									work environment for Insular’s employees, but also to better

									serve its policyholders and other people it transacts with.</p>

									<p class="indent mobile-text">In 2016, RPD sold off &#8369;2.8 billion worth of properties, the

									highest ever, for which Insular Life gained &#8369;1.8 billion. On the

									leasing front, RPD contributed &#8369;345.2 million in revenues. It

									also successfully reduced its repair and maintenance costs

									by as much as 19 percent, with its &#8369;60-million investment

									in brand-new and energy-efficient air-conditioning units

									already translating to &#8369;26.8 million in annual savings for ILCC

									Alabang alone. </p>

								</div>

								<div class="story-body">

									<p>During the year, RPD also aligned Insular’s rental

									rates with industry standards, with an average increase of

									15 percent, while putting in place structures and amenities

									comparable with Grade-A buildings in Alabang, Muntinlupa

									City, and the Makati Central Business District (CBD) that

									command much higher rental costs. </p>

									<p> RPD was also instrumental in concretizing the <span class="ital">“Magandang Araw”</span>

									 customer service experience by

									refreshing the external and interior look of all Insular Life

									buildings starting in 2010. The project was completed in

									two years, and today, Insular Life policyholders, employees,

									and guests will feel the same warmth and aura of home in

									whatever Insular Life office they visit. </p>

									<h2>Building for the future</h2>

									<p>In 2017 and the coming years, RPD expects to

									surpass its stellar performance in real property leasing and

									management in 2016, mainly due to the reopening of the

									new Insular Life Makati building. </p>

									<p>It is also eyeing the acquisition of new properties

									in the Bay City area and in thriving cities outside of the

									metropolis, namely, in Cebu, Davao, Iloilo, Bacolod, and

									other Visayas and Mindanao cities. Business and IT-BPO

									activities are in the pink of health in these cities, and RPD

									plans to ride the wave to deliver the best value to Insular’s

									policyholders. </p>

									<p>“We are future-proofing the Company. Our role

									as a far-sighted guardian is to enhance and safeguard

									policyholders’ hard-earned money through real property

									investments. That’s why we are investing in real estate for

									the long haul,” Mr. Caunan said.</p>
