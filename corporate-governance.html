									<p class="title">Steadfast <span>Commitment</span></p>

								</div>

								<div class="corporate-governance-body">

									<p class="big">In its 106 years of doing business, Insular Life has ingrained corporate governance principles and practices in all of its strategic initiatives and business affairs. Amid stricter regulatory environment, rapidly evolving technology, and increased industry competition, the Company remains steadfast in its commitment to good governance in all levels of its organization.</p>

									<h2>Corporate Governance Confirmation Statement</h2>

									<p>The Company adopts internationally recognized corporate governance best practices to serve its stakeholders’ interests. It complies with local laws, rules and regulations which include the Insurance Commission’s (IC) Corporate Governance Principles and Leading Practices, and other related guidelines. These principles and practices are reflected in the Company’s Manual on Corporate Governance (MCG) and Code of Conduct. The MCG, the Company’s Articles of Incorporation, and its By-Laws provide guidance to the Board of Trustees and its Committees in performing their duties and responsibilities in an effective and ethical manner. The Company’s Code of Conduct prescribes the conduct of Insular Life professionals as they observe and embody its core values to promote a culture of good corporate governance. The Company monitors compliance with these guidelines through regular audit and annual review of performance. These policies demonstrate that the Company is in full compliance with

									the mandates of corporate governance.</p>

									<h2>Board of Trustees</h2>

									<p>The Board sets the tone in fulfilling the Company’s commitment to protect the interests of its Stakeholders as it carries out its fiduciary duties.</p>

									<p>The Board steers the Company towards its goals. It monitors the implementation of corporate strategy and reviews its vision and mission statements. The Board delegates the day-to-day management of the Company to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), the President and Chief Operating Officer (COO), and to other members of Senior Management. However, the Board retains oversight and monitoring functions. It also determines and approves the remuneration of Management and Executive Trustees, including that of the CEO. Compensation received by key management personnel is disclosed in the “Notes to the Financial Statements” section of this report.</p>

									<h2>Board Composition and Diversity</h2>

									<p class="no-indent">The composition of the Board of Trustees takes into account the following criteria:</p>

									<ol>

										<li>a member of the Company</li>

										<li>a Filipino citizen </li>

										<li>a resident of the Philippines </li>

										<li>with qualifications that are aligned with the strategic directions of the Company</li>

										<li>none of the prescribed disqualifications, all of which are in accordance with the Company’s By-Laws.</li>

									</ol>

									<p>Apart from these qualifications, the selection of a Trustee is not restricted to age, race, gender or religious belief.</p>

									<p>In selecting a Trustee, the Company adheres to the provisions of its By-Laws and Manual of Corporate Governance that cover the following:</p>

									<ul>

										<li>Announcement of acceptance of nominations for the position of a Trustee as published in newspapers of general circulation;</li>

										<li>(NomCom) of the Board of the names of the Nominees and their written acceptance of the nominations; and</li>

										<li>Election during the Annual Members’ Meeting.</li>

									</ul>

									<p>The NomCom undertakes the process of identifying the qualities that must be possessed by a candidate which must be aligned with the Company’s strategic directions. In addition, they ensure that all the Trustees possess relevant competence and experience for the Board and Board Committee membership.</p>

									<p>The Company uses professional search firms and other external sources when looking for qualified candidates for the Board, if necessary.</p>

									<p>The nine (9) members, led by the non-executive Chairman, Mr. Luis C. la Ó, were elected for their competence and unquestionable integrity. All Trustees are experts in their respective fields and possess all the qualifications set in the Company’s By-Laws and MCG.</p>

									<p>To ensure efficient and effective decision making, all Trustees are required to devote time and attention necessary in the performance of their roles, including sufficient time to be familiar with the Company’s business, in accordance with the MCG.</p>

									<p>In 2016, the Board had an equal mix of Executive, Non-Executive, and Independent Trustees, thereby ensuring a balanced structure and diversity of perspectives during Board meetings. A third of the Board is also composed of women. None of the Independent Trustees occupy board seats in more than five (5) publicly listed companies (PLCs) and there is also no Executive Trustee who sits in more than two (2) boards of PLCs. Full disclosure of any significant change in the directorships or other significant commitments outside of Insular Life is required from each of them.</p>

									<p>The Company has three (3) Independent, Non-Executive Trustees, namely: Messrs. Luis Y. Benitez Jr., Delfin L. Lazaro, and Nico Jose S. Nolledo. They are known for their expertise in accounting and audit, banking, finance, management and information and communications technology. Mr. Benitez is a Certified Public Accountant and has previously occupied an executive role in one of the leading audit firms in the country. Mr. Lazaro is a business executive with a distinctive career that spans decades in the public and private sectors. Mr. Nolledo is a leader in transformative techno-preneurship. They are all independent of management.</p>

									<p>The Company complies with the Insurance Commission’s Circular Letter 2014-49 dated 11 December 2014 that provides for the maximum term limit of Independent Directors/Trustees.</p>

							<div class="message-container">

								<div class="corporate-governance-body">

									<h2 class="no-leading">Board Orientation and Continuing Education</h2>

									<p>The Chairman of the Board provides for an adequate Board orientation and continuing education process, both for new and incumbent Trustees, in accordance with the MCG. All new Trustees are oriented on the Company’s structure, business, legal and regulatory environment, and corporate governance practices. They are also apprised of vital corporate documents and relevant policies that define their duties and responsibilities as a Trustee. The in-house orientation is conducted by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President and Chief Operating Officer, and the Corporate Secretary.</p>

									<p>The Company encourages its Trustees to attend ongoing or continuous professional education programs to enrich their expertise and experience. It seeks new avenues to further improve its corporate governance framework beyond the legal and regulatory requirements to protect the interest of all stakeholders. All Trustees have attended a corporate governance orientation in compliance with the Insurance Commission’s Fit and Proper requirement.</p>

									<p>The Company held a corporate governance seminar entitled “Corporate Governance and Risk Management” for its Board and Management on 31 March 2016, with no less than Insurance Commission Deputy Commissioner Vida T. Chiong giving the opening statement and providing an overview of the current regulatory environment, as well as the future directions of the Commission. The resource speakers, Ms. Rebecca G. Sarmenta and Mr. Leonardo J. Matignas, Jr. of Sycip, Gorrez, Velayo and Company 

									(SGV & Co.), provided the attendees with regulatory and enterprise risk management updates.</p>

									<h2>Board Movements</h2>

									<p>To ensure continuity in business operations and a seamless transition in case of changes in the membership of its Board and Senior Management, the Company has a succession planning policy as provided in the By-Laws and in the MCG.</p>

									<h2>Chairman of the Board</h2>

									<p>Mr. Luis C. la Ó, who replaced Mr. Victor B. Valdepeñas as Chairman of the Board of Trustees upon the latter’s resignation on 31 July 2016, has extensive experience as Director/Trustee and as a member of senior management in life, non-life insurance, and reinsurance companies. As a Non-Executive Trustee, he exercises the functions of his office independently from management and is free from any interest, any business or other relationships that could interfere with his independent judgment. His roles and responsibilities as Chairman of the Board are stated in the MCG. His credentials are also indicated in the Credentials Section of this Report.</p>

									<h2 class="no-leading">Management</h2>



									<p>Management implements the business strategy towards the attainment of corporate objectives and handles the day-to-day operations of the business, keeping in mind the interests of its stakeholders.</p>

				 					<p>Management ensures that the objectives of the Company are clearly cascaded and communicated to all members of the organization.

				 					<p class="strong">Key Risks and Material Controls</p>



				 					<p>Insular Life recognizes the possibility that various business risks may be encountered in the course of its operations. These could be risks relating to strategic, operations, legal and regulatory compliance,reputational and financial risks. To prevent and manage these risks, the Board oversees the Company’s risk management infrastructure, reviews the Company’s risk appetite, and provides direction towards risk mitigation. The Board monitors and evaluates the Company’s total risk management process with the regular review and assessment of the Company’s risk management systems. The Board, upon the recommendation of various Board Committees and Management, installs appropriate material control mechanisms (such as operational, financial, and compliance controls) for accurate monitoring and effective management and control of key risks. These controls are regularly audited to check their effectiveness and reliability.</p>



				 					<p>Based on the reviews performed by the internal and external auditors of the Company submitted to the Audit and Risk Management Committee (ARMC), the ARMC believes that the Company has adequate internal controls/risk management systems in place.</p>



				 					<p>Benefits in connection with business expansion or development must also be weighted carefully against potential risks to protect the interest of all stakeholders. In instances when there would be mergers, acquisitions and/or takeover requiring Policyholder-members’ approval, the Board shall appoint an independent party to evaluate the fairness of all aspects of the transaction, including its transaction price.</p>
